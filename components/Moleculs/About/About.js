            I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my
            first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom
            brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to
            type on.

            The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When
            I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard
            while wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted down from
            three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a
            bit of momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.

            I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
            while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
            badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I sent
            my dad’s Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a photo back
            down to our family computer from space.
